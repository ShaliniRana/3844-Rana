<h3>I am a VT-shaped student because...</h3>
    
<h4>T-Shaped Student</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Vertical Component:</b><p>I have a depth of understanding within my field of Creative Writing. Through my critical reading and writing skills of major works in American literature and the writing of my own creative pieces, I am able to understand the complexities of humanity through an empathetic and artistic lens.</p></li>
    <li><b>Horizontal Component:</b><p>I have transdisciplinary knowledge and technical literacy, based on the classes I have taken, that span across <i>the arts:</i> Creative Writing, Sociology, Fine Arts, Italian, Public Speaking, Global Affairs, Greek, and American Literature AND <i>technology/science/business:</i> Data Analytics, Java Programming, Information Systems, Accounting, Economics, Biology, Marketing, and Statistics. </p></li>
</ol> 
<h4>The V-Shaped Student</h4>
<p>Since my freshman year, my academic experiences have stretched beyond the classroom. I participated in an Alternative Spring Break program in West Virginia where I helped rebuild old homes. I took Community Writing, a class in which I taught elementary-aged kids from a low-income community in Christiansburg creative writing skills. I studied abroad for a semester in Switzerland and conducted international research through the Presidential Global Scholars program within the Honors College. And just this past spring break, I participated in a study abroad to Cuba hosted by Pamplin College of Business. Through these international experiences, I have gotten two international research articles published through the university. For fun my freshman year, I DJed for WUVT, Virginia Tech's college radio station that broadcasts to several local counties. This experience allowed me to learn technologies used in studios (soundboards, turntables, mics) and express myself as a music-lover. I'm constantly in search of accumulating experiences that transcend different areas of knowledge, in order to learn and grow as much as I can. In other words: I am comfortable doing and learning everything life has to offer.</p>

<h4>My Plans and Goals</h4>
<p> I am a "jack of all trades, master of none" kind of person. I like to wear many hats, and hope to continue doing this in the future. I love learning on my own terms and want to absorb everything I can in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Right now, my goal is to finish my internship and undergrad strong, and in a way where I am proud of the work I've produced and the memories I have made. I plan on moving back to Northern Virginia after I graduate and work at a tech company. However, knowing me, I might just end up anywhere. Because of my nature of wanting to try everything, I hope to gain experience in more non-traditional jobs at some point, such as a barista job or bartendending job to broaden my life experiences in general. In order to stay true to my artistic and musical nature, I hope to also keep writing and learning a musical instrument for fun. After working in some different places for different companies, I hope to go back to school, most likely in the humanities or some joint technology/humanities program (hopefully more of those pop up in the future!). After educating myself and making money, I hope to work as a professor so that I can inspire youth and give back in the same way my professors at VT have. Currently, I'm applying for an ETA position with the Fulbright program in Bulgaria, so who knows, I might end up there after graduation! I'm all over the place in terms of what I want to do in my life, and I like it that way :).</p>

<h4>Recommendations for a Future VT-Shaped Student!</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Don't be afraid to try everything you're interested in (there's an organization for everything at VT).</li>
  <li>Before coming to college, really reflect on what you WANT to study. No major is ever going to define you if you let it, so have fun with exploring your options and don't be afraid of having to change your major later on. If you are focused on living an intentional life doing what you care about, then it'll be worth it.</li>
  <li>Have fun, make friends, and get to know your professors (They want to know you too).</li>
</ul>
