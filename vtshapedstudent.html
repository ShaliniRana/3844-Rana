<h3>I am a VT-shaped student because...</h3>
    
<h4>T-Shaped Student</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>Vertical Component:</b><p>I have a depth of understanding within my field of Creative Writing. Through my critical reading and writing skills of major works in American literature and the writing of my own creative pieces, I am able to understand the complexities of humanity through an empathetic and artistic lens.</p></li>
    <li><b>Horizontal Component:</b><p>I have a transdisciplinary knowledge and technical literacy, based on the classes I have taken, that spans between <i>the arts:</i> Creative Writing, Sociology, Fine Arts, Italian, Public Speaking, Global Affairs, Greek, and American Literature AND <i>technology/sciences/business:</i> Data Analytics, Java Programming, Information Systems, Accounting, Economics, Biology, Marketing, and Statistics. </p></li>
</ol> 
<h4>The V-Shaped Student</h4>
<p>Since my freshman year, my academic experiences have gone beyond the classroom through an Alternative Spring Break trip I took to do service for a week in West Virginia, Community Writing: a class in which I taught elementary-aged kids from a low-income community in Christiansburg creative writing skills, my semester long study abroad to Switzerland through the Presidential Global Scholars program, a spring break study abroad to Cuba this past semester hosted by Pamplin, and two international research articles I got published through the university. In addition to the interdiscplinary courses I have taken during my semesters at Tech, I also DJed for WUVT, our college radio station, which allowed me to learn technologies used in the studio (soundboards, turntables, mics) and express myself as a music-lover. I'm constantly in search of accumulating experiences that transcend different areas of the brain, in order to learn and grow as much as I can. In other words: I just want to do everything!</p>

<h4>My Plans and Goals</h4>
<p> I am a "jack of all trades, master of none" kind of person. I like to wear many hats, and hope to continue doing this in the future. I love learning on my own terms and want to absorb everything I can in this beautiful lifetime.</p>
<p>Right now, my goal is to finish my undergrad experience and internship experience strong, and in a way where I am proud of the work I've produced and the memories I have made. I might take a break after school to come back to NoVA, live at home, and try out some odd jobs, such as, bartending or being a barista. I hope to learn to master one kind of artistic form during this time--either some kind of dance or musical instrument (I wouldn't mind starting a band, since I used to sing and play guitar). I am considering going back to Virginia Tech after my break in order to earn another undergrad degree in a technical program. Right now, I am looking at the Computational Modeling and Data Analytics program that is brand new at VT. In addition to fostering my arts skills, I really want to learn to master the disciplines of math, computer science, and statistics, on my own terms.</p>

<h4>Recommendations for a Future VT-Shaped Student!</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Don't be afraid to try everything you're interested in (there's organizations for everything!).</li>
  <li>Before coming to college, really reflect on what you WANT to study (there's a major for everything--and you can always change it later on).</li>
  <li>Have fun! Make friends! And talk to your professors! (They want to help you).</li>
</ul>
