            <h3>T Aspect of the VT-shaped Model</h3>
            <p>My podcast reflects the T aspect within the VT-shaped student model on a broad level through the introduction I give about myself and my story. I introduce myself as a Creative Writing student who used to be in the Business Information Technology program here at Tech. The T aspect describes a student who is not only well-versed in their area of knowledge but also able to apply cross-disciplinary skills and thinking into their lives.</p>
                    <p>The strongest example I gave of this, as it applies to my own life, is when I explained my work environment at Ford and my Alternative Spring Break experience. In an abstract way, my skills in Creative Writing, or that aspect of my brain that comes naturally, allow me to express the empathetic communicative side of myself in a way that produces real connection with others. In expressing these parts of me that I am traditionally well-versed in, I was able to make a connection with the electrician I met during my Alternative Spring Break and have been able to be an active, communicative young employee right now during my time at Ford.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the cross-disciplinary skills come from my experience in BIT and my technical family. By taking classes in Java, VBA, general business, etc. and coming from a background where tech is always a topic of discussion, I understand bits of the tech side which set me apart from any typical Creative Writing student. I love being a multi-faceted person who embraces both sides of knowledge because it allows me to relate to many different types of people and make meaning and connections in the world unique to my own ways of thinking.</p>
