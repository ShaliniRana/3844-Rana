<h4>Hello! My name is Shalini and I am a Creative Writing student studying at Virginia Tech.</h4>
    <p>My experience with digital writing is limited, but I have taken coding classes before. I love learning about the art of coding as it intersects with one of my passions: writing. With tools from both the left brain and right brain, we can do anything!</p>
    <p>The VT-Shaped Student concept is a new way Virginia Tech is marketing the education it offers to incoming students. From what I've heard thus far, I am in favor of this new and exciting concept. </p>
