<h4>The concept as it applies to me</h4>
<p>I hope you notice the variety in the things I enjoy doing! Although I’m naturally a right-brainer, I constantly straddle between the two ways of learning and knowing—through my discovery in both the arts and technology. Coming from a family of technologists, I learned to appreciate technology while fostering my passion in creative writing, and each day I am learning how to meld the two disciplines to create beauty in this world. You could say that I am only one example of a VT-shaped student. I think that is the beauty of a VT-shaped student that embraces the T-shaped lifestyle: no two students will ever look the same. It is NOT a one-size-fits-all educational model, and that is a GOOD thing.</p>

<h4>Why writing and digital media?</h4>                    
<p>Writing and digital media seems to perfectly combine both my understanding of coding and my passion for writing, so it is a useful skill I’ll be taking with me as I venture farther in life. WDM is both an art and science and seems to be a discipline that the future VT-shaped student should learn while at VT. After developing an understanding of subjects within both the arts and sciences, these students should be given the freedom to create projects solving real-world issues that combine the interdisciplinary skills they learn inside and outside of classes. Whether the concept is labeled with a name or not, I think it is beneficial for every person to learn skills in both the arts and sciences/technology. I support the concept of the VT-shaped learner because it seems to foster this idea of embracing both sides of knowledge.</p>
