<p>These are some of the things I have enjoyed doing while at VT! Although I’m naturally a right-brainer, I constantly straddle between the two ways of learning and knowing—through my discovery in both the arts and technology. Coming from a family of technologists, I learned to appreciate technology while fostering my passion in creative writing, and each day I am learning how to meld the two disciplines to create beauty in this world.</p>

<p>Digital writing seems to perfectly combine both my understanding of coding and my passion for writing, so it is a useful skill I’ll be taking with me as I venture farther in life. Digital writing is both an art and science and seems to be a discipline that the future VT-Shaped student should learn while at VT. After developing an understanding of subjects within both the arts and sciences, these students should be given the freedom to create projects solving real-world issues that combine the interdisciplinary skills they learn inside and outside of classes. Whether the concept is labeled with a name or not, I think it is beneficial for every person to learn skills in both the arts and sciences/technology.</p>
