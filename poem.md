# <i>The VT-Shaped Student's Manifesto: A Poem</i>
## Shalini Rana
It’s strange. I came into college knowing I would be a business student.

No one should enter a new phase of their life knowing something. It’s dangerous.

In life, we aren’t taught to explore—only to know, and stick with the path. 

I didn’t believe in the dreams I already had because I was told they were all fruitless pursuits that should be left for dreamers. Writing poetry? Studying music? Forget it. Not important. 

Mom majored in IT so we thought that would be the best for me. Money, stability, technology. 

I didn’t know a person could be multiple things. Sometimes I still doubt it when they tell me it’s not true. 

From a path of constant labels and people charting the course for me, my soul now tastes what it means to be free. 
Creative writing is me, but I am not a poet, a writer, a this or that. Labels are toxic. I am all of the above. A little technical a little creative a little 

> little

> little

> (jack of all trades, master of none) 

We need an educational model that supports every young person’s need to be all of the above. We need to be <i> all of the above </i> people in order to keep humanity awake. 

> (V)T-Shaped.

> Over-engaged.

> Double brained. 

That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. (And left. And left. And left. BRAINED.)

But please don't forget

Dear University, 

Oh World, 

To let people be free. 

Don’t let the label take over; each student has different interests, passions, ways of thinking—foster all, understand all, keep questioning and improving the model…

And you, Student, 

Use the tools you learn in all aspects of life—

Like I, the creative writing student, 

(I am not the model but follow my example)

with a new arsenal of ways to understand the world: 

`HTML5. GitHub. CSS. Markdown. Websites, websites, websites.`

Who knew a creative writing student could create a website? Thanks, Tim Berners-Lee. 

So, learn and learn and learn; pick fruit from both sides of the tree.

Claim your own knowledge, for it will set you free.
